# Contributing to MyScript Web Components

We welcome pull requests to MyScript Web Components. If you'd like to new or larger feature, keep reading.
If you have any questions, or want help solving a problem, feel free to stop by the [#MyScript forum](https://dev.myscript.com/support/forum/).

#### Adding new features

Components are distributed as sets of HTML and CSS files. If the feature you want to add is similar to an existing component, add your contribution to these files.

If you create a new component, you should create a new set of file (HTML and CSS) associated to this new component. File name should be the component name in smallcaps.

## Testing

Local testing can be using the `web-component-tester` engine through a web server. First, install all dependencies
`bower install` from the root folder of the project, then open the test page from a web browser.

#### Testing in other browsers

MyScript Web Components supports all major browsers. Unfortunately, it is hard to test new changes in many browsers. If you can, please test your changes in as many browsers as possible.

## Style guide

Code

 - 4 spaces for indentation
 - 120 character line length
 - declare variables in the outermost scope that they are used

In general, try to make your code blend in with the surrounding code.
